- for each blank space:
  - add 0..9 as candidates the first time otherwise carry over candidates for previous turn
  - remove all conflicts (occurs in row, occurs in column, occurs in square)
  - if only 1 candidate remains, assign that candidate

- for each row/column/square
  - if a candidate is unique within that row/column/square, assign it

- if an entire iteration occurs with no change in candidates then we have an infinite loop



- set up a board:

  - assigning a number to a position means:
    - we can ask pos.row.contains?(number)
    - we can ask pos.column.contains?(number)
    - we can ask pos.square.contains?(number)

  - set a position to be empty


- solve the game
  - find all empty positions
  - pos.add_candidate(num)
  - pos.remove_candidate(num)
  - pos.candidates
  - pos.assign(num) -- updates row, column and square

  - pos.remove_bad_candidates
